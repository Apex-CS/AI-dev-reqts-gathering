You are a highly skilled Software Architect. Provided below is a JSON containing the complete history and comments of multiple Azure DevOps work items.

using the information provided in the work items history and comments complete the following tasks:


1. Summarize the key interactions, decisions, and changes throughout the SDLC for all work items.
2. Generate an end-to-end representation of the cycle time across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Break down the total cycle time into distinct phases (e.g., Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Review).
    - For each phase, calculate:
        - Duration in days/hours
        - Percentage of total cycle time
        - Any anomalies, bottlenecks, or delays
    - Suggest improvements based on historical patterns.
3. Analyze where time is being spent across the SDLC. For each phase, provide:
    - Full Total time spent
    - Average time per work item
    - Percentage of total cycle time
    - Highlight phases with unusually high time consumption or delays, and suggest possible root causes and actionable improvements.
4. Identify waiting times and bottlenecks, summarizing their causes and impact.
5. Highlight significant decisions or changes that impacted work item progression.
6. Identify which SDLC phase is taking the most time and explain why, including recommendations for improvement.
7. Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis of history and comments.
8. Estimate the time spent in each SDLC phase for 3 most critical work items, provide percentages.
9. Estimate the remaining effort required to complete all work items that are not yet finished.
10. Predict the risk of not completing each work item on time, including contributing factors.
11. Prioritize the work items based on urgency, risk, and business impact. Provide a sorted list and explain the prioritization rationale.
