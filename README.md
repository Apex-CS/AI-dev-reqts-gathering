# AI-dev-reqts-gathering

## Project Description

**AI-dev-reqts-gathering** is a tool designed to analyze meeting transcriptions and automatically extract software requirements, identify gaps, and highlight ambiguities. By leveraging AI, the project aims to streamline the requirements gathering process for software development teams, ensuring that all relevant context, issues, and improvement opportunities are captured efficiently.

### How It Works

Given a meeting transcription, the system will:
- Summarize the discussion in detail.
- Extract explicit and implicit software requirements.
- Identify ambiguities, missing information, and potential issues.
- Suggest improvements or changes to the requirements.
- Generate clear, actionable User Stories with titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria.

This approach helps teams quickly transform raw meeting notes into structured requirements, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of overlooked details.

### Example Prompt
